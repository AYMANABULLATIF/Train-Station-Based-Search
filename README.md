# Train Station Based Search

## Project Description
Train Station Based Search is a web application designed to help users minimize transportation costs by finding places within walking distance of train stations, near their home, or along their commute to work. Users can register their personal information, including home and work addresses, and specify their most frequently used train line. The application assists users in discovering new places conveniently located within their regular routes, promoting cost-effective travel and daily commuting.

This project showcases the developer's ability to independently manage the end-to-end development of a full-stack web application, incorporating advanced features such as user authentication, data integration with Google Maps API, responsive design, and support for dark mode.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML5/CSS3:** For the structure and styling of the web pages, including responsive design and dark mode support.
  - **JavaScript:** For client-side logic, including form handling, DOM manipulation, and interaction with the Google Maps API.
  - **Bootstrap:** For the grid layout and responsive design.

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js & Express.js:** To handle API requests for user registration and login.
  - **Google Maps API:** Integrated for map display, place search, and distance calculations.
  - **JSON:** For data exchange between frontend and backend.

- **Tools and Libraries:**
  - **Fetch API:** Used for making asynchronous requests to the backend server.
  - **Local Storage:** For persisting user preferences like dark mode.

## Key Features
- **User Registration and Login:**
  - Secure user registration form that captures essential information (username, email, home and work addresses, preferred train line).
  - Upon successful registration, users are redirected to the main application page.

- **Dynamic Station Selection:**
  - The application dynamically populates the start and end station options based on the user's selected train line.

- **Place Search and Display:**
  - Users can search for specific places or types of locations (e.g., cafes, restaurants) within a set distance from their selected stations.
  - Results display the nearest station, distance, and detailed information about the place, including images, reviews, and ratings.

- **Map Integration:**
  - The application utilizes the Google Maps API for displaying locations on a map, with additional features like small map previews within side panels.

- **Dark Mode:**
  - The application includes a toggle for dark mode, enhancing usability in low-light environments.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on devices of various screen sizes.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Google Maps API Integration:** Gained hands-on experience in integrating and utilizing various Google Maps services, including Places and Geometry libraries.
- **User Authentication:** Developed a secure and scalable approach to handle user registration and data management.
- **Responsive and Accessible Design:** Learned to implement a responsive layout and dark mode, improving the application's usability.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Successfully managed the development of both frontend and backend components, showcasing versatility in handling different aspects of web development.

This project reflects the ability to learn new technologies and apply them to create a fully functional, user-centric application, making it a valuable addition to a growing portfolio.
